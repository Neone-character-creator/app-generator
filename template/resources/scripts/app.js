/*
Replace this file with the entry point for your app.

Your app must implement the following API:
attach a function named `character` to the `window` object. This method takes one optional argument.
- If called with undefined, `character` acts as a getter. Return a JSON stringified form of your current character data.
- If called with an argument, `character` acts as a setter. The argument is the persisted JSON string of your character. Parse and use it to set your character state.

console.log('hello world!');
