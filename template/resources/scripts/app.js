/*
Replace this file with the entry point for your app.

Your app must implement the following API:
When the app loads, it initializes with a brand new character.

Attach a function named `character` to the `window` object. This method takes one optional argument.
- If called with undefined, `character` acts as a getter. Return a JSON stringified form of your current character data.
- If called with an argument, `character` acts as a setter. The argument is the persisted JSON string of your character. Parse and use it to set your character state.

Optionally, attach a function named 'export' to the 'window' object. This enables exporting to PDF.
- If called, returns the JSON stringified state of your current character.
